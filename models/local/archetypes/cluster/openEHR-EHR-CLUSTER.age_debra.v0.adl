			use = <"Use to record age at onset or age at diagnosis where a textual description such as 'antenatal', 'neonatal', 'juvenile' etc. is required.

The age data point is modelled as a choice to allow numeric values (years, months, weeks and days) to be recorded as well.

This cluster may be replaced in due course by a corresponding data point in the core problem/diagnosis archetype.">
