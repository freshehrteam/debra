			purpose = <"To capture Birmingham Epidermolysis Bullosa severity score for adults.
Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is the name used to describe a group of rare inherited skin fragility disorders.  This means that the skin is very weak or fragile and tears at the slightest scratch or trauma. Epidermolysis Bullosa usually presents at, or soon after, birth and children and young people with Epidermolysis Bullosa may develop blisters and ulcers on the skin and often inside the mouth (mucous membranes). 
The severity of the condition varies widely between the different types of Epidermolysis bullosa, ranging from occasional blistering of the hands and feet to severe blisters over the whole body.">
